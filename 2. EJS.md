# Templating with EJS

## What is Templating?

Templating is a technique used in web development to generate HTML dynamically. Instead of writing HTML directly in your code, you create templates with placeholders for dynamic data. These templates are then filled in with data during runtime to generate the final HTML content that is sent to the client's browser.

## Why EJS?

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a popular templating engine for Node.js and web applications. It allows developers to embed JavaScript code directly into their HTML templates, making it easy to generate dynamic content. Some reasons why EJS is preferred by developers include:

- **Familiar Syntax**: If you're already familiar with HTML and JavaScript, learning EJS is straightforward because it uses a syntax that is similar to both languages.
  
- **Versatility**: EJS can be used for a wide range of templating tasks, from simple variable substitution to complex logic and control flow.
  
- **Active Community**: EJS has a large and active community of developers, which means you can easily find help, resources, and third-party libraries to extend its functionality.
  
- **Integration with Express**: EJS integrates seamlessly with Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, making it a convenient choice for building dynamic web applications.

## Using EJS for Dynamic Pages

### 1. Tags

EJS provides several tags that allow you to embed JavaScript code and control the flow of your templates. Some common EJS tags include:

- `<% %>`: Executes JavaScript code without outputting anything.
  
- `<%= %>`: Outputs the result of evaluating a JavaScript expression into the template.
  
- `<%- %>`: Outputs the result of evaluating a JavaScript expression into the template, but HTML-encodes the output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

These tags enable you to dynamically generate HTML content based on the data and logic in your application.

### 2. Parsing Data

With EJS, you can easily parse data from your backend server and incorporate it into your templates. This allows you to create dynamic pages that display different content based on user input or database queries.

### 3. Partials and Layouts

Partials are smaller, reusable components of a web page, such as headers, footers, or sidebars. EJS allows you to include partial templates within your main templates, making it easier to reuse code and maintain consistency across your application.
